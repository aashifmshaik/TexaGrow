# TexaGrow: Heat-Resistant Drip Irrigation for Sustainable Farming
## Research Question:
How can a drip irrigation system powered by Arduino help save water and improve plant growth in hot weather?
## Hypothesis:
If I create a smart drip irrigation system with a moisture sensor, it will use less water and keep the soil at the right moisture level for healthy plant growth.
## Engineering Goal:
To build a durable and smart irrigation system that senses soil moisture, waters only when needed, and helps save water while keeping plants healthy.
